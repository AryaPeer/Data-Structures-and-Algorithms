# Data Structures and Algorithms Assignments

This repository contains the code for three assignments for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. The assignments are organized into three separate subfolders, each representing a different data structure implementation in C++. 

## Assignments:

- Assignment 1: Circular Queue and Dynamic Stack

- Assignment 2: Sequential List and Doubly Linked List

- Assignment 3: Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree
